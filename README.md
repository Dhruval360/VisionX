Objective : To create an automated parking lot management system.

Implementation : We would like to use computer vision to tackle the hassles of maintaining a large chain of multi-storeyed parking lots. For this, we would like to use popular python libraries like OpenCV-python, numpy, pandas, etc.

Let us consider a large parking lot chain with services that one could subscribe to.
Upon request of a subscriber, we could direct him to the nearest parking lot that has room for his/her vehicle.
Upon entry to the parking lot (after security screening) a camera would scan the vehicle for the subscriber's details.
Parallelly, the parking lot management system would scan the entire lot (using a few ceiling-mounted cameras) for empty spots and directs the verified user to the nearest empty parking spot.
Upon exit from the lot, the vehicle is scanned again and the user is charged according to the time of stay.
This entire operation will be completed without any human dependency and is completely autonomous.

Application : Apart from large parking lot chains, this project could find major use in the parking lots at malls, hospitals, commercial streets, schools, and colleges, etc. This would largely benefit the parking space operators as it would be very inexpensive and easy to operate with minimum maintenance and a stark decrease in manpower required, hence saving a lot of revenue for the company. Also, there is improved security

Final result : With this idea of smart parking lot system implemented:

Decreased management costs and increased quality of service.
The user's precious time wouldn't be wasted and overall stress on the user would be reduced.
Less fuel would be wasted (no need to go searching for an empty parking lot)
Future prospectives : We would like to carry on with this idea and implement it first in our college since a large number of students use this facility which is ideal for testing. We would also include appropriate noise buzzers when suspicious activity is recognized during parking of the vehicle. On successfully implementing it in our college and optimizing our systems, we would implement it in large chain of multi-storeyed parking lots. supermarkets, malls, etc.
